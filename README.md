# Easy Shop

This Project focuses on Redux toolkit (RTK) to manage state of an E-commerce Platform with styling from TailwindCSS.
There are three slices created for different aspects of the ecommerce app namely pproductsSlice, cartSlice and CategoriesSlice.
This project gave me deep understandin how Redux toolkit manages the state of an app and how smooth it makes to access the state in different components of the app.
